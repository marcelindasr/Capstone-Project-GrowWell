# GrowWell App - Machine Learning

## Bangkit Product Capstone Project 2024
Bangkit Capstone Team ID : C241-PR569

Welcome to the branch repository focusing machine learning for the GrowWell app, a Bangkit 2024 Capstone project.

## **Description:**
The Machine Learning models can be used to provide information about a child's predictions about his nutritional status, whether he is stunted or not based on his age, gender and height.

## **Method**
Classification with a Neural Network

## **Tools**
Python
TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas
Seaborn
os
Matplotlib
Google Collab
Visual Studio Code

## **Dataset**
We get the dataset from kaggle with the title "Stunting Toddler (Balita) Detection (121K rows)"
- **[Stunting Baby/Toddler Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rendiputra/stunting-balita-detection-121k-rows)**

## **How to Predict**
Machine Learning models can predict the nutritional status of children/toddlers which are categorized into four categories:
- Severely stunted (stunting parah)
- Stunted (stunting)
- Normal
- High (tinggi)

This machine learning predict the nutritional status of children/toddlers by entering several inputs:
- Age
- Gender
- High

## **Deployment**
We use Tensorflow.js to deploy a trained Machine Learning model on Android.
